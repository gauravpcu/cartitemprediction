# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the existing Lambda functions to align with the working functionality demonstrated in the hybrent.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains a complete end-to-end implementation of product-level forecasting using Amazon SageMaker DeepAR, which needs to be deployed as serverless Lambda functions for production use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the Lambda functions to implement the same data processing and feature engineering logic as the working notebook, so that the production system produces consistent results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw data is uploaded to S3 THEN the enhanced_feature_engineering Lambda SHALL process it using the same temporal feature extraction logic as the notebook
2. WHEN data processing occurs THEN the system SHALL create the same product lookup tables and customer-product relationships as demonstrated in the notebook
3. WHEN feature engineering runs THEN it SHALL generate cyclical time encodings, holiday flags, and demand patterns exactly as shown in the notebook
4. IF the notebook uses specific pandas operations THEN the Lambda functions SHALL replicate those operations for consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Lambda functions to use the same SageMaker DeepAR model training and inference approach as the notebook, so that predictions are accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prediction requests are made THEN the enhanced_predictions Lambda SHALL use the same SageMaker endpoint invocation pattern as the notebook
2. WHEN preparing data for SageMaker THEN the system SHALL format input data in the exact same structure as demonstrated in the notebook
3. WHEN processing SageMaker responses THEN the Lambda SHALL parse and transform results using the same logic as the notebook
4. IF the notebook includes specific hyperparameters or model configurations THEN the Lambda functions SHALL use identical settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the API endpoints to return the same prediction format and insights as generated by the notebook, so that the user experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the product prediction API THEN it SHALL return predictions in the same JSON structure as the notebook output
2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL use the same Bedrock prompting strategy as demonstrated in the notebook
3. WHEN calculating product demand patterns THEN the Lambda SHALL apply the same statistical calculations as the notebook
4. IF the notebook includes specific visualization data THEN the API SHALL provide equivalent data structures for frontend consumption

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Lambda functions to handle the same data validation and error scenarios as the notebook, so that the system is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is encountered THEN the data_validation Lambda SHALL apply the same validation rules as implemented in the notebook
2. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL handle exceptions using the same error handling patterns as the notebook
3. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the Lambda SHALL generate the same warning and error messages as the notebook
4. IF the notebook includes data cleaning steps THEN the Lambda functions SHALL implement identical data cleaning logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the Lambda functions to use the same external service integrations as the notebook, so that all components work together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with S3 THEN the Lambda functions SHALL use the same bucket structure and file naming conventions as the notebook
2. WHEN calling Amazon Bedrock THEN the system SHALL use the same model parameters and prompt templates as demonstrated in the notebook
3. WHEN storing results in DynamoDB THEN the Lambda SHALL use the same table schema and data structures as implied by the notebook
4. IF the notebook includes specific AWS service configurations THEN the Lambda functions SHALL replicate those configurations
