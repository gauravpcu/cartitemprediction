# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current AWS Lambda deployment is failing due to package size limitations. Several Lambda functions (DataValidation, FeatureEngineering, and Predictions) exceed the 262MB unzipped size limit when including heavy dependencies like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. This feature will optimize Lambda function packaging and deployment to resolve size constraints while maintaining functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Lambda functions to deploy successfully within AWS size limits, so that the application can be deployed and function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying Lambda functions THEN the unzipped package size SHALL be less than 262MB
2. WHEN Lambda functions are invoked THEN they SHALL have access to all required dependencies
3. WHEN optimization is applied THEN function performance SHALL not be significantly degraded

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Lambda Layers for shared dependencies, so that I can reduce individual function package sizes and improve deployment efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Lambda Layers THEN common dependencies SHALL be packaged in shared layers
2. WHEN functions use layers THEN they SHALL successfully import and use layer dependencies
3. WHEN layers are updated THEN dependent functions SHALL automatically use the updated versions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to minimize Lambda function package sizes, so that deployment is faster and more reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packaging functions THEN unnecessary files and dependencies SHALL be excluded
2. WHEN optimizing packages THEN only production dependencies SHALL be included
3. WHEN comparing sizes THEN optimized packages SHALL be at least 50% smaller than original packages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain function separation and modularity, so that each Lambda function only includes dependencies it actually uses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing function dependencies THEN each function SHALL only include required libraries
2. WHEN splitting functionality THEN functions SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN refactoring THEN function interfaces SHALL remain compatible with existing integrations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment processes to handle optimization, so that manual intervention is minimized during deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running deployment scripts THEN optimization SHALL be applied automatically
2. WHEN building packages THEN the process SHALL validate size constraints before deployment
3. WHEN deployment fails due to size THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the issue and solution
