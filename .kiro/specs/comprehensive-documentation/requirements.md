# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive, valuable documentation for the Enhanced Order Prediction Solution. The current project has basic documentation but lacks the depth, structure, and clarity needed for effective adoption, maintenance, and scaling. The goal is to transform the existing documentation into a world-class resource that serves developers, architects, business stakeholders, and end users.
